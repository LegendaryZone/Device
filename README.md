# Device: League of Legends level bot (vs. AI)

- Auto login, enter queue, accept match, play and repeat.
- Available champions: Ashe, Sivir, Tristana
- Random input times to avoid risk of detection.
- Accounts can be tracked and controlled from the manager application. Create a **local.txt** file in the same path of every Server executable and put local network IP of the machine you're running the manager application from.
- Sends bot information to a remote endpoint specified in **url.txt** (tracking in a web page)
- Can connect as many VMs as you want on the local network.
- Highly customizable code (meaning it needs cleaning)

I'm not responsible for any bans your account could get using this code.
